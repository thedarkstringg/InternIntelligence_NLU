			       		THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT:

			      		Natural Language Understanding (NLU)

Task : : Implement and fine-tune a natural language understanding model for tasks like named entity recognition (NER) or intent classification.

Details:
- Data Preparation: Collect and preprocess text data for the task.
- Model Selection: Use pre-trained models like BERT or GPT and fine-tune them for specific NLU tasks.
- Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, or ROUGE.

Deployment: 
- Implement the model into a chatbot or text analysis system.

Where to Do It:
- Hugging Face Transformers: Fine-tune pre-trained models for NLU tasks.
- SpaCy: Implement NLU pipelines and model training.
- Google Colab: Develop and test NLU models with cloud-based resources.
